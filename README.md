# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Using-Python

# Exploratory Data Analysis Project
This project contains the code and data used to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. The goal of the EDA is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and trends within the data, and to identify any potential issues or outliers that may affect subsequent analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis are Redwine, Student performance, Algerian Forest fires, Flight price, Google Playstore  . It consists of 100000s observations and 1000s variables.

# Methodology
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for this project was conducted using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code used to perform the analysis and generate the visualizations can be found in the filename.py file.

The following steps were taken:

- Data loading and cleaning: 
The dataset is loaded into a dataframe, missing values are handled, and any necessary data transformations are performed.

- Data visualization:
Various plots and graphs are generated to visualize the distribution of the data and any patterns or relationships between variables.

- Summary statistics:
Summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range are calculated to provide a better understanding of the data.

- Outlier detection:
Any potential outliers are identified using visualizations and statistical methods.

- Conclusion: 
Based on the results of the EDA, conclusions are drawn about the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, as well as any potential issues that may need to be addressed in subsequent analysis.

The code is well-documented with comments to help readers understand the purpose and functionality of each section of the code.
